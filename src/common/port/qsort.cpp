/*
 *	qsort.c: standard quicksort algorithm
 *
 *	Modifications from vanilla NetBSD source:
 *	  Add do ... while() macro fix
 *	  Remove __inline, _DIAGASSERTs, __P
 *	  Remove ill-considered "swap_cnt" switch to insertion sort,
 *	  in favor of a simple check for presorted input.
 *
 *	CAUTION: if you change this file, see also qsort_arg.c, gen_qsort_tuple.pl
 *
 *	src/port/qsort.c
